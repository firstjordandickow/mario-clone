VICTORY SCREEN

The third Candy Cane, now safe and sound,
The Kingdom was now well, all around!
The Fly King swarmed away in defeat,
"Curse you Squire, you have me beat!"

And thus the whole Kingdom rejoiced,
The Squire, to a pedestal they did hoist,
And made him Leader of the Guard,
For all his days, held in regard!
