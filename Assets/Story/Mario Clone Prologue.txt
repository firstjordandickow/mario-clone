PROLOGUE
All was bright, and all was fun,
All was good, and all was love,
All was great, and all was sweet,
In the lovely Kingdom of Treats.

But, oh, what's this? It cannot be!
What came, nobody could foresee!
Such blight, this sight;
Such fright, our plight!

The Fly King'd come to consume this land!

"I've come for thine Candy Canes,
And I'm ready to bring pain.
Give me what I covet,
Or you can all just shove it!"

His foul gnats swarmed all o'er the realm,
The Jelly Bean Guards were fast overwhelmed!

Oh, what hope is there, for this peaceful place?
Will it be doomed to a disgusting fate?
