DEFEAT SCREEN

The Squire had mustered all he could,
And set on his Quest in the name of good.
But lo, his best turned out for naught, 
The Canes, the Fly King's minions caught!

"This land is mine," the fiend did taunt,
"Now I'll eat all the treats I want!"

And then the flies swarmed all the Treat Folk,
Nibbling through them, stroke by stroke.
And as they left the world in pain,
They all cursed the poor Squire's name!
