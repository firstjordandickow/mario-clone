Oh, but then, in our darkest hour,
When er'thing was at it's most dour,
A Hero rose up in courage,
Surely, he's the Fly King's scourge!

Jell-io, 'till now but a squire,
But burning with such inner fire!
"Have no fear, my good King,
The Candy Canes, to you I'll bring!"

"Go forth, young warrior," the King commanded,
"But do not fail," he then demanded.
"For if the Flies get to them first,
We shall die under their curse!"

"The very first Cane, where does it lie?
Outside the tower; get there before the flies!"
